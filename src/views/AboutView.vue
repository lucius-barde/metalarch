    <h1>About Metal Archiver</h1>
    <p>This is a demo made with Vue.js and the custom made OppidumWeb API, which displays data about metal bands in a mobile-friendly interface.</p>
    <p>The data comes from Encyclopaedia Metallum, also known as <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com" target="_blank">Metal-Archives</a>.</p>
    <p>This was done for educational purposes, there is no intention of stealing data etc. A local cache is used as much as possible to prevent heavy requests.</p>

    <p>Metal Archiver was made by <a href="https://www.oppidumweb.net" target="_blank">Lucius Barde</a> in 2022-2023.</p>
